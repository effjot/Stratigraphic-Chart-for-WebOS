This is a geologic timescale, or to be more exact, the International
Stratigraphic Chart (ISC, version of 2009). You can look up all
formally defined stratigraphic units, the time (million years before
now) they have begun, whether they've defined by a “Global
Boundary Stratotype Section and Point” (GSSP), and their
“official” RGB colour codes.  For some units, there's
a bit of additional geologic and paleontologic information.

Currently, the app interface is in English or German.  The names and
additional information are not translated to German (yet).

The app is still work in progress, any corrections, translations and
suggestions for improvements are welcome.


Overview of source code
=======================

Directory "lisp":

This Common Lisp code contains various lumped-together information for
the International Stratigraphic Chart and produces the necessary HTML
and JSON files for the app.


Directory "mojo":

Mojo (JavaScript) code for the app itself.  Default language is
English, localisation for German is found in "resources".  Directory
"data" contains the HTML stratigraphic chart (shown in "table" scene)
and the JSON database of information on the stratigraphic units (shown
in "details" scene), both generated by the Lisp code.
